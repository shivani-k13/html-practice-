You’ve learned how to style different elements using a class. This is noted in the style 
sheet with a period in front of it and is called up by spacing once inside an element and 
typing class=”classname”. You can name a class whatever you want (no spaces or 
punctuation), but for it to work, you must be sure the class is in the CSS as indicated.        
    </pre>
        For this assignment-
        <ul style="margin-right: 70px;">
            <li>In your classite folder,create a new called c1.</li>
            <li>In c1,creaye three files-two HTML files and a CSS file. You will out all CSS in the external
                stylesheet(not yet) and NOT on the HTML file as <u>coolclass1.html</u>a nd <u>coolclass2.html</u> and
                the css as <u>cool.css.</u></li>
            <li>Change the page title for both html files to be: <br>
                coolclass1.html title-- First off, I am cool! By Your Name <br>
                coolclass2,html-- Secoundly,I rock! By Your Name</li>
            <li>In the head,<u>link</u>both files appropriately so they will use the cool.css style sheet (HINT: link
                the relationship and include the
                type and reference)</li>
            <li>You will make up your own information (words) and it must be error-free in spelling and grammar. The
                general theme is
                coolness…so go with it (you can even get your information from the internet, copy/paste, etc., but edit
                and be sure it is
                error-free and appropriate!)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>coolclass1.html should have an h1 heading, a paragraph, a line, and h2 heading, a paragraph, another
                    h2 heading,
                    a paragraph, a line, and then a paragraph with a link to coolclass2.html</li>
                <li>coolclass2.html should have an h2 heading, a paragraph, an h3 heading, a paragraph, another h3
                    heading, a
                    paragraph, a line, and a h2 heading that reads These Are Cool… then a numbered list of your top five
                    best cool
                    things. After that, another paragraph that includes a link back to the home page (coolclass1.html).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once all your pages are created, THEN work on the style sheet. You must style as follows</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Default/body: Arial font family, size 14, navy blue text with pale pink background</li>
                <li>h1, h2, h3: All should be Arial Black with Arial as the backup font; letters should be kerned
                    (spaced) 3 pixels; text
                    should have both an overline and an underline</li>
                <li> h1 should be centered and all capitals (uppercase) </li>
                <li>.hot class should be created that uses letter kerning of 6 pixels, hot pink text, italics, and
                    yellow background</li>
                <li> .cold class should be created that uses bold, bright blue text and pale blue background with a
                    kerning of 20px and
                    set to centered</li>
                <li>Lines/rules should be set to have a color set to red and height of 5 px</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Apply the classes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply the .hot class to the last h2 heading on coolclass1.html</li>
                <li>Apply the .cold class to the first heading (h2) on coolclass2.html</li>
                <li>Apply the .hot class to the final paragraph (the one after the list) on coolclass2.html</li>
            </ul>
            <li>On the stylesheet, comment out at the bottom (just follow the format at the top of a new CSS document--
                /* words */)
                Stylesheet created by your Name (so you will know it belongs to you when you print it)</li>
            <li> Preview everything in Internet Explorer and check to be sure everything is showing up properly
                (especially look for the
                under/overlines that don’t appear in Dreamweaver and verify that links are working)</li>
            <li>Print the CSS style sheet and the codes from coolclass2.html ONLY. (2 printouts) </li>
            <li>Call me over for a screencheck (scoring guide is on the back of this sheet); have the first page open in
                IE and be ready to
                click the hyperlink when asked. </li>
            <li>Put completed scoring guide with attachments in the tray!</li>
        </ul>
